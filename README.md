# Distress data
This repository contains the raw data that were used in preparing the manuscript:  
**"Comparison of distress during cholestasis, chronic liver injury by CCl4, pancreatic cancer and chronic pancreatitis using the RELSA score"**

The data contain six different experimental treatments:
 1. Pancreatitis
 2. Bile duct ligation
 3. CCl4
 4. Telemeter implantation
 5. Pancreatic cancer (+t)
 6. Pancreatic cancer     

Each treatment has different subgroups, called "conditions" in the table (total = 12). 
The experimental lengths ("day") were different and a total of n=120 animals are reported in these data.
Baseline data are labelled as day=-1 in analogy to the RELSA standard.

The data can be observed directly in GitHub, downloaded or, i.e., imported into R.

## RELSA data
A second data set from the RELSA algorithm/package was used in the abovementioned manuscript. These data can be obtained either directly from the RELSA package via RELSA::postop, or, downloaded [here](https://github.com/mytalbot/RELSA/blob/master/raw_data/tm_post-op.txt/).  

## Citation and terms of use
The data are presented in the manuscript **"place title here"** which is currently under review.  
You may use the data for scientific purposes only.   
Please cite the paper when the data are used.  

Enjoy!
